      <description>I have made four rust programs for programmatically generating artwork in different styles. Here is a sample in each style, along with an explanation of the algorithms:
Disrupted continuity Algorithm: Choose locations in a random order. At each location, choose the pixel color with the smallest possible color distance from that of the surrounding pixels that have been placed, weighted by the distance of the surrounding pixels.

      <description>This is a writeup of a D&amp;amp;D character I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about, strictly from a story perspective, not a mechanical one.
First impression She&amp;rsquo;s a young, small girl, mid-teens. She looks from side to side, uncertain. Her hands are clasped at her waist.
She is wearing chain armor, with a hood folded back. The armor is painted white, with red droplets of blood spilling down from the shoulders and neck.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the middle of the night, and you&amp;rsquo;re the lookout for danger to your country. On the horizon, you spy an advancing army. Quick! You must ride to rally the Militia to defend your country.
You have a map of the locations of all of the militia members throughout your country. However, they&amp;rsquo;re all spread out. If you need to wake them up yourself, it&amp;rsquo;ll take far too long. Fortunately, once you wake up a militia member, you can instruct them to help you rally the rest of the militia.</description>

      <title>Sylvester-Gallai Theorem</title>

      <description>The Sylvester-Gallai Theorem is a deceptively simple theorem in geometry. It meets all four of my criteria for a great theorem:
 Easy to state Interesting to think about Hard to prove from scratch Has a simple proof  The theorem is as follows:
For any finite set of distinct points in the Euclidean plane, either
 all of the points lie on a single line; or there exists a line that contains exactly two of the points.</description>

      <title>Inside and Outside View</title>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a couple cases where people have looked at an issue from the inside and from the outside. In one, the subject of schooling, I have the outside view. I come at schooling as a student, a user of schooling. I am not a teacher, though I may one day become one. In the other, the subject of machine learning, I have the inside view. I understand ML from the perspective of a computer scientist.</description>

      <title>Three Worlds Collide</title>
      <link>https://isaacg1.github.io/posts/three-worlds-collide/</link>

      <description>I read a very thought provoking story: Three Worlds Collide, by Eliezer Yudkowsky.
One high level moral question that the story asks, is how to treat an alien species with severely different moral viewpoints from one&amp;rsquo;s own. In particular, how to act when the other species&amp;rsquo; actions are horrific, by one&amp;rsquo;s own moral stance. Call this the &amp;ldquo;horrific morals&amp;rdquo; question.
Here I will not attempt to tackle the more difficult object-level moral question of which of the three species moral&amp;rsquo;s are good or horrific, but instead the meta-level moral question of how one should act upon encountering such a species.</description>

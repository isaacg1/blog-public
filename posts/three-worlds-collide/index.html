    <h1 class="title">Three Worlds Collide</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>I read a very thought provoking story: <a href="http://robinhanson.typepad.com/files/three-worlds-collide.pdf" target="_blank">Three Worlds Collide</a>, by Eliezer Yudkowsky.</p>

<p>One high level moral question that the story asks, is how to treat an alien species with severely different moral viewpoints from one&rsquo;s own. In particular, how to act when the other species&rsquo; actions are horrific, by one&rsquo;s own moral stance. Call this the &ldquo;horrific morals&rdquo; question.</p>

<p>Here I will not attempt to tackle the more difficult object-level moral question of which of the three species moral&rsquo;s are good or horrific, but instead the meta-level moral question of how one should act upon encountering such a species.</p>

<p>I will abbreviate the Babyeaters as B, the Humans as H, and the Superhappies as S.</p>

<p>First, let us discuss the answers presented in the story to the horrific morals question.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Attempt to convince the other species, by words but not force, of the error of their ways.
Maintain open communication and interaction between the species.
This option is attempted by B, immediately upon learning of the horrific morals of H.</p></li>

<li><p>Force the other species to conform to one&rsquo;s own morals.
Use guns and brainwashing to make it happen.
This option is proposed by some individuals within H, upon learning of B.</p></li>

<li><p>Calculate a &ldquo;mutually satisfactory&rdquo; middle ground between the moral stances,
and then force the other species to conform to those morals,
while simultaneously reshaping one&rsquo;s own species accordingly.
Use guns and brainwashing to make it happen.
This option is executed by S upon B by force, and attempted by S upon H by force.</p></li>

<li><p>Isolate one&rsquo;s species from the other, so that one&rsquo;s species cannot be changed by force.
This is the option that H takes against S&rsquo;s use of force, in the second ending.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The intuitively correct choice to me is option 1. This disagrees with the moral intuitions of the characters in the story, and therefore probably from the moral intuitions of the author.</p>

<p>Some of the H characters seem to prefer option 2 when they are in a position of power, and option 4
when power is wielded upon them. Others prefer option 3, though they are dismayed by its effects on themselves.</p>

<p>The story consistently refers to option 3 as cooperating, and option <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> as defecting, even though option 3 is carried out by force upon a unwilling population. The story seems to treat option 1 as unworthy of discussion, due to the horrificness of the actions committed. Option 1 does not end with the other species actions stopped or meliorated, and so the story does not consider it further.</p>

<p>To me, option 1 seems the most appealing because the outcome that I deeply want to avoid is morally awful things being forced upon the members of my group by the moral standards of my group. While I care about groups even more distant than my species, I don&rsquo;t care about them as much as I care about my species. I am willing to do force my morals upon another if it means having another&rsquo;s morals forced upon me. I care much, much more about what happens to my species than what happens to another species, even as I care for both. Even for all of the &ldquo;shut up and multiply&rdquo;, I do not weight the preferences of an individual of my species and one of another species all too equally.</p>

<p>So option 1 seems to be the true cooperative option to me, where no participant is forced to do anything against its will.</p>

<p>At its core, this seems like a deontological injunction to me: &ldquo;If your morals are telling you to commit genocide, your morals have a problem.&rdquo; &ldquo;If your morals are telling you to forcible rewrite other people, your morals have a problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alien invasions have been a classic science fiction trope for decades. Always the question remains: Why would aliens come and bother us? Whatever they want, there&rsquo;s an easier way to get it. This story answers that question: The aliens invade because their morals have been offended. Or to put it another way, we invade because our morals have been offended. To that I say, before we know whether we are the invaders or the invaded, let us restrain our moral indignation, as we wish others would.</p>

<p>I stand with the Babyeaters, and against alien invasions.</p>

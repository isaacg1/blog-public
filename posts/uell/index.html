<p>This is a writeup of a D&amp;D character I&rsquo;ve been thinking about, strictly from a story perspective, not a mechanical one.</p>

<h2 id="first-impression">First impression</h2>

<p>She&rsquo;s a young, small girl, mid-teens.
She looks from side to side, uncertain.
Her hands are clasped at her waist.</p>

<p>She is wearing chain armor, with a hood folded back.
The armor is painted white, with red droplets of blood spilling down from the shoulders and neck.
Two words are written in green, at the edge of each of the cuffs of the armor: Arma &amp; Atar.</p>

<p>Stapped across her back are a mace, painted white with red spikes, and a shield, with an emblem of Ilmater painted accross the back.
The emblem depicts two hands clasping each other&rsquo;s wrists, bound together with red string.</p>

<p>Her hair formed into a long braid, spilling halfway down her back.
The hair is tied at the end with a neat strip of cloth.
Even in the daylight, the hair-tie is glowing, a bright magenta-red.</p>

<h2 id="spellbook">Spellbook</h2>

<ul>
<li>Light: blacern (bla-cern, &ldquo;a&rdquo; like man, &ldquo;e&rdquo; like err)

<ul>
<li>Purple-red: teafor (te-a-for, &ldquo;e&rdquo; like meh, &ldquo;a&rdquo; like ma, &ldquo;o&rdquo; like four)</li>
<li>White: albe (&ldquo;a&rdquo; like ma, &ldquo;e&rdquo; like meh)</li>
<li>Black: blaecce (blek-se, &ldquo;e&rdquo; like led, &ldquo;e&rdquo; like meh)</li>
<li>Green: grennes (gren-nes)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>From: fram (fram)</li>
<li>Evil: atol (a-tol)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sanctuary: ciricfrith (sir-ic-frith)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="childhood">Childhood</h2>

<p>At the age of four, her mother (Illia Manra, nee Holt) drops Uell off at her local church of Ilmater.
She says she needs to leave her husband, and she can&rsquo;t take care of a kid right now.
She tells the abbess that Uell&rsquo;s name is just Uell, no last name.
She wants her kid to grow up away from her past and from her husband.</p>

<p>Uell grows up at the Church of Ilmater, with the orphans.
She learns duty, respect, discipline, and most importantly endurance, in the face of any and all hardship.
She learns the prayers of Ilmater, practices the service to the poor and the oppressed, and the duties of an acolyte.
She becomes humble, deeply caring, quiet and nervous.</p>

<p>In the first few years, her mom visits every few months.
As time goes on, the visits become less and less.
The last visit comes when Uell is nine.
Her mom says goodbye.
Uell cries, just a little.</p>

<h2 id="adolescence">Adolescence</h2>

<p>As an acolyte of Ilmater, one of Uell&rsquo;s main duties is helping the poor.
Uell visits a downtrodden neighborhoods and triages people:</p>

<ul>
<li>Those who need comfort. The grieving, the unsure, the tempted.</li>
<li>Those who need community. Those who want to work, who are having trouble raising a family, who feel danger.</li>
<li>Those who need relief. The sick, the targeted, the hurt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, she gives what help she can.
Connects people who can help each other.
Teaches people how to react, how to escape, or how to cope.
Most of all, gives people patience.
To take choices only purposefully.
And endure until then.
That is the core of Ilmater&rsquo;s ways.</p>

<h2 id="awakening">Awakening</h2>

<p>The situation on the mind of the people is the investigation of the life-force cult.
While details are slim, more and more people &ldquo;of high class and standing&rdquo; are reporting feeling drained of their life energy, correlated with times when certain &ldquo;unsavory characters&rdquo; are around.
Quickly, the &ldquo;unsavory characters&rdquo; are brought to &ldquo;justice&rdquo;, in the form of ever-growing rounds of public whippings.</p>

<p>I had to do what I could around the edges.
Comforting those who lost siblings and family to the cult hunt.
Every night, I cried, and every night I prayed to Ilmater.
But it is said that Ilmater could save anyone being tortured, provided the torture broke the laws.
And so no one responded to my prayers.</p>

<p>But then came a special day.
My 15th birthday.
On that day, I learned a special prayer.
A prayer for special intercession.
And as I prayed, for the very first time, I heard something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good dawn, child. Are you ready to help?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, there&rsquo;s only one possible answer to that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent. You and others have told me of something, something that splits me at the core of my being. Something that needs to be seen to be believed. Will you be my eyes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again, there&rsquo;s only one possible answer when your god asks that.</p>

<p>The next day, when I woke up, my eyes were glowing. I had trouble looking at anything that wasn&rsquo;t bright. Everything was sunlight and black shadows. I could feel the pressure, the intensity of the presence behind my eyes.</p>

<p>That day, I went to the site of the &ldquo;trials&rdquo;.
A massive crowd thronged.
I stood at the back, on a crate, so I could see a little better.
Past the heads of the taller men, I could make out two children on a raised pedestal at the center of the square.
Both were chained to a post at the center of the pedestal.</p>

<p>A local magistrate, clothed in formal black, stands at the pedestal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These two stand accused of the most despicable deeds as a member of the life-force cult.
They lived next door to a hospital, and over the course of three months, they drained the life out of fourteen defenseless victims.
Fourteen!
And all to conduct their nefarious magics.
Due to the severity of their crime, the usual judicial process has been suspended.
They are hereby sentenced to be lashed until dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that, the kids start to cry, sobbing uncontrollably.
And the crowd cheered at the magistrate&rsquo;s pronouncement.
And the whips began to land, loud heavy cracks.</p>

<p>I wanted to look away, but I knew my purpose here.
I heard a voice, and I thought I&rsquo;d accidentally spoken aloud.
It sounded exactly like me.
But everyone in the square reacted as if the sound came from right next to them.</p>

<p>It said &ldquo;This is not justice.&rdquo;
At first it was said in a conversational tone, sounding just like I was talking to the person next to me.
Then it got louder.
And louder.
Until it boomed out over the square.
I&rsquo;ve never yelled that loudly in my life, but I still recognized my voice.
The only sounds that competed with it were the monotonous cracks of the whip.</p>

<p>With each impact of the whip, my heart leapt in empathy.
The whip was slow now, painful but not too damaging, but it would worsen quickly.
I began to feel the impacts of the whip as if they were hitting my own flesh, getting harder faster and faster.
I felt a bond, reaching out and connecting me to the two on the platform.
I could see the two of them start to straighten up, their tears start to dry.</p>

<p>The whipper starts to lay into them, hitting them as hard as he possibly can.
I feel each impact, much harder now, shaking me body.
And yet still, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt.
I feel the glow in my eyes grow stronger.
The chant in my voice stops, abruptly.
People in the crowd start to murmur, unsure of the situation.</p>

<p>The shackles on the two kids grow white and red.
They start to rattle, then drop open and clatter to the ground.
The whipper stops momentarily, stunned by this turn of events.
Then the kids themselves start to glow. White over the formerly dusty clothes, red where the whip split through the skin, leaving welts underneath.
They rise up into the air, floating up and up.
The executioner recovers just enough to try to grab the child on the left as she floats away.
But she slips through his grasp.
As they float above the executioner&rsquo;s outstretched arms, I hear a final booming sentence in my voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two of them float up, and up, and up and up.
Until they are too small to be seen.</p>

<p>Their names are Arma and Atar, and I helped my god Ilmater rescue them.</p>

<h2 id="initiation">Initiation</h2>

<p>The kids came down later that day, in another town, at the top of the tower of the largest church of Ilmater in the city.</p>

<p>The local magistrate lost considerable public support.
He resigned.</p>

<p>Ilmater kept speaking to me.
&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s work was good.
You have the determination, the patience, and the understanding of right and wrong that I require.
But most of all, I found it easy to channel through you.
My works could not have been so mighty if I went through another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you do it more? To help people?&rdquo;</p>

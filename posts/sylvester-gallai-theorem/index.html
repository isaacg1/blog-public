    <h1 class="title">Sylvester-Gallai Theorem</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester%E2%80%93Gallai_theorem" target="_blank">Sylvester-Gallai Theorem</a> is a deceptively simple theorem in geometry.
It meets all four of my criteria for a great theorem:</p>

<ol>
<li>Easy to state</li>
<li>Interesting to think about</li>
<li>Hard to prove from scratch</li>
<li>Has a simple proof</li>
</ol>

<p>The theorem is as follows:</p>

<p>For any finite set of distinct points in the Euclidean plane, either</p>

<ul>
<li>all of the points lie on a single line; or</li>
<li>there exists a line that contains exactly two of the points.</li>
</ul>

<p>Criterion 1 is clear, assuming I didn&rsquo;t flub the definition.
Criterion 2 is subjective, but I have fun imagining wacky arrangements of points that try to put at least three points on every line.
Criterion 3 can be seen by working on the problem a bit, pr by looking at the history of the problem. The theorem was first posed as a problem by J. J. Sylvester in 1893, and it was not solved until 1941, and not widely known to be solved until 1944.
As for Criterion 4, here is an impressively simple proof, due to Leroy Milton Kelly:</p>

<p>Suppose <em>S</em> is a finite set of points in the Euclidean plane that are not collinear.
Let <em>L</em> be the set of all lines that contain at least two points in <em>S</em>.
For each line <em>l</em> in <em>L</em>, let <em>l</em>&rsquo;s <strong>minimum miss</strong> be the smallest distance from <em>l</em> to any point not contained in <em>l</em>.</p>

<p>Let <em>l&#42;</em> be the line in <em>L</em> with smallest minimum miss. As it turns out, <em>l&#42;</em> contains exactly two points in <em>S</em>.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that <em>l&#42;</em> contains at least three points in <em>S</em>, for sake of contradiction.
Let use <em>p</em> to denote the point in <em>S</em> that lies closest to <em>l&#42;</em> without being on <em>l&#42;</em>.
Let us use <em>p&rsquo;</em> to denote the point on <em>l&#42;</em> that is closest to <em>p</em>. Note that the line <em>pp&rsquo;</em> is perpendicular to <em>l&#42;</em>.</p>

<p>Since we are assuming that there are at least three points in <em>S</em> on <em>l&#42;</em>, at least two of them must be on the same side of <em>p&rsquo;</em>,
or one coincides with <em>p&rsquo;</em>.
Let us call the farther point <em>a</em> and the nearer point <em>b</em>, where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are on the same side of <em>p&rsquo;</em>, or <em>b</em> is <em>p&rsquo;</em>.
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> cannot all be <em>p&rsquo;</em>.</p>

<p>The contradiction lies in the fact that <em>b</em> is closer to the line <em>ap</em> than <em>p</em> is to <em>l&#42;</em>, which contradicts the definition of <em>l&#42;</em>.</p>

<p>To see that this is true, let <em>b&rsquo;</em> be the closest point on <em>ap</em> to <em>b</em>.
Then <em>ab&rsquo;b</em> and <em>ap&rsquo;p</em> are similar triangles, as they are both right triangles and they share the angle <em>pab</em>.
Therefore, the ratio of <em>ab</em> to <em>bb&rsquo;</em> and <em>ap</em> to <em>pp&rsquo;</em> are equal.
However, <em>ap &gt; ap&rsquo; â‰¥ ab</em>.</p>

<p>Thus, <em>pp&rsquo; &gt; bb&rsquo;</em>. This contradicts the definition of <em>l&#42;</em>, showing that the assumption must be false.</p>

<hr />

<p>This level of clarity (if augmented with a diagram or two, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester%E2%80%93Gallai_theorem" target="_blank">the Wikipedia page</a>) is what every proof should aspire to, although it is not always possible.
It&rsquo;s interesting to look at what theorems look like if they are missing each of the above criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not easy to state: Much of higher mathematics can be beautiful and deep and simple to prove, but requires a great deal of machinery to state.</li>
<li>Not interesting to think about: A fair amount of the output of automatic theorem-provers can look like this.</li>
<li>Not hard to prove from scratch: More of a puzzle than a theorem.</li>
<li>No simple proof: The four color theorem, or the classification of finite simple groups.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;ll continue to seek out theorems that have all four of these criteria, and put them on this blog.</p>

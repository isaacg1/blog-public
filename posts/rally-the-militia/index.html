    <h1 class="title">Rally the Militia</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>It&rsquo;s the middle of the night, and you&rsquo;re the lookout for danger to your country.
On the horizon, you spy an advancing army.
Quick! You must ride to rally the Militia to defend your country.</p>

<p>You have a map of the locations of all of the militia members throughout your country.
However, they&rsquo;re all spread out. If you need to wake them up yourself, it&rsquo;ll take far too long.
Fortunately, once you wake up a militia member, you can instruct them to help you rally the rest of the militia.</p>

<p>Can you rally the militia quickly, regardless of where the are, and how but the militia is?</p>

<hr />

<p>Let&rsquo;s turn this in to a mathematical problem.
Let&rsquo;s say the country is a square, with side length one.
The lookout starts at an arbitrary point in the country, and the militia is at an arbitrary set of points in the country.
Let&rsquo;s say everyone moves at a rate of one, and can only move when awake.
Everyone except the lookout starts asleep, and people can only be woken up by another person reaching their location.
All information is public.</p>

<p>The goal is to wake up everyone in a constant amount of time,
not dependent on the number of militia members.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here&rsquo;s a way we can accomplish this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The lookout wakes up an arbitrary other person.</li>
<li>Split the square in half vertically.</li>
<li>Each of the two awake people wake up an arbitrary person in their half of the square.</li>
<li>Split the half squares in half horizontally.</li>
<li>Each of the two people in each rectangle wake up an arbitrary person in their subsquare.</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ol>

<p>How long does this take in total?
Let&rsquo;s call the first wakeup phase 1, then the two people they wake up next phase 2, then the four people they wake up ext phase 3, and so on.
The time that needs to be spent in a phase is at most the maximum distance anyone needs to travel in that phase, because everyone travels at speed 1.</p>

<ul>
<li>The maximum distance anyone needs to travel in phase 1 is <em>sqrt(2)</em>, the maximum distance within the square.</li>
<li>The maximum distance anyone needs to travel in phase 2 is <em>sqrt(2)</em>, the maximum distance within the square.</li>
<li>The maximum distance anyone needs to travel in phase 3 is <em>sqrt(5)/2</em>, the maximum distance within a rectangle with side lengths 1 and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li>The maximum distance anyone needs to travel in phase 4 is <em>sqrt(2)/2</em>, the maximum distance within a sub-square with side length <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li>The maximum distance anyone needs to travel in phase 5 is <em>sqrt(5)/4</em>, the maximum distance within a rectangle with side lengths <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.</li>
<li>And so on</li>
</ul>

<p>These distances, leaving out phase 1, form a pair of geometric sequences, which makes it easy to sum the sequence.
The total is 3 sqrt(2) + sqrt(5), which approximately equals 6.479. Every militia can be rallied in at most 6.479.</p>

<hr />

<p>Follow-on questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Can you devise a strategy that rallies an arbitrary militia faster than 6.479?
It seems like this strategy is pretty inefficient, and even some small changes might bring big improvements.</p></li>

<li><p>The slowest militia to rally that I know of consists of the four corners of the square and the center point, with the lookout at the center.
This militia takes at least 2 + sqrt(2)/2 to rally, which is roughly 2.707. Can you find a militia that takes longer to rally?</p></li>
</ul>
